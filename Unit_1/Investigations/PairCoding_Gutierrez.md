**Pair Coding**
## Introduction
In this small investigation we will see the concept of pair coding because it was not found as such, the concept of pair programming or pair programming is seen, in the breakdown of the investigation the benefits of using this type of programming are revealed and the difficulties of this.
## Development
In pair programming, one developer codes while the other watches and reviews progress. Done right, pairwise programming can speed up development time, improve code quality, and prevent human error.
Pair programming is an agile technique that originates from extreme programming (XP), in which two developers come together and work on one computer. The two people work together to design, code, and test user stories. Ideally, the two people would be equally skilled and each would have the same coding time.
Pair programming uses the four-eye principle, ensuring that two pairs of eyes review the code being produced even when there is a division of labor. While a person writes test cases using test-based development techniques.
### Advantage
The potential benefits are when you do it, how to do it right, and motivate yourself to do it in tough times. The main goals of the matchmaking can help you with the quality of the software and the flow of the team.
- Knowledge exchange
- Reflection
- Maintain focus
- Code review on the fly
- Two modes of thinking combined
- Property of the Collective Code
- Keeps the WIP of the equipment low
- Quick onboarding of new team members
### Disadvantages
- Matchmaking can be exhausting
- Intense collaboration can be difficult
- Meeting interruptions
- Different skill levels
- Power dynamics
- Pairing with many Strangers
- There is no time for yourself
- Rotations lead to context change
- Matchmaking requires vulnerability
- Convince managers and coworkers
## Conclusion
It is a good practice for those who are starting or are already experts since, as we saw in this investigation, when one is programming and the other observing, errors are seen and the necessary changes can be made.
For work teams that are of different levels as we saw it, it is a difficulty or disadvantage but it can also be taken as an advantage because knowledge is leveled and shared.
