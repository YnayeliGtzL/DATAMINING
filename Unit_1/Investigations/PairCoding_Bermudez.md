**Pair Coding**

## Development 

*What it is?*
The method known as pair programming (in Spanish, programming in pairs)It is mainly used in agile software development and, more specifically, inextreme programming (XP). Pair programming specifies that there are always twopeople working on the code at the same time and that, as far as possible,they sit together. One is in charge of writing the code and the other of supervising inreal time. At the same time, they are constantly exchanging impressions:they discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.

*Is it really more efficient?*

Like everything in this life, there is no single and absolute answer as to whether this istrue, whether or not pair programming improves productivity. However, they havecarried out numerous case studies in this regard, which, normally,conclude that in the long run (not in the first project) the productivity of theteam with pair programming.

*Advantage*
- One benefit of pair programming or pair coding is that the software projectit won't depend so much on key developers. Thanks to the collaborative wayof working and learning together, there will always be more than one developerfamiliar with the same part of the system.
- Programmers learn to work as a team.
- Communication flows more often and more efficiently.
- It creates continuous, peer-to-peer learning and is easier than anew member of the team quickly get to work and get to know the environment.


*Disadvantages*
- The couple must be equally committed and participatory during theduration of the task. Otherwise, there would be no profit.
- Working in this way can be exhausting as working alone willyou can give small breaks instead as a couple you have to join therhythm of the other and that can become overwhelming and exhausting
- There may be cars in the way of programming of each one by what ishas to work in a more general way for both of you to understandthe code
- You have to work with people who are at the same level and experience,otherwise it could be counterproductive and slow down efficiency

## Conclusions
To get the most out of this way of programming, both people must orhave a lot of experience working in a team or they must know each other a lotgood to know their programming styles, their form of communication, their levelfrom experience. I think this is a very good way to program because atbetter you can not see your mistakes but someone else makes it easier whatthey are doing wrong and it can help guide you but obviously it will always betied to the types of programmers they have, they can be very good butthey just don't work as a team
