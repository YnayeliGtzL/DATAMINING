**Grammar of  Graphics**

## Development 

Seville established an analogy (which should not be interpreted literally) between grammatical construction and the structure of a graph. In this way, he arrived at equivalences such as those seen in the following table.<br>
  



| *Graphic text*                               	| *Text*                    |
|--------------------------------------------	|-------------------------	|
| Graph                                      	| Sentence                	|
| Infographic                                	| Paragraph               	|
| Represented magnitude                      	| Subject of the sentence 	|
| Visual impression produced by the graph    	| Predicate of a sentence 	|
| Graph with a single data series            	| Simple sentence         	|
| Graph with more than one data series       	| Compound sentence       	|
| Graphic related to other in an infographic 	| Subordinate sentence    	|
<br>

But it went further. From the analysis of many graphs he drew some conclusions to recommend some tips with which to build a graph that would not give rise to confusion and would be faithful to its original message. They are the ones that we can see in the following table.


|                 	| Summary of the recommendations analyzed thoughout the book                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
|-----------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| *Orthography*     	| The subject must be defined<br>There must be concordance between the type of graph and the type of data<br>It must include explicit, comprehensive and well-referenced axeT                                                                                       	|
| *Sintax*          	| The magnitude represented must be the same for all the data<br>Axes and scales must keep a certain proportion<br>Adequacy of the information density<br>A minimum composition should be incorporated and visual effects should be avoided                         	|
| *Semantics*       	| With the same data there are different representations according to the message<br>You can do demagogy with flawless graphics<br>Small formal errors help demagogic effects<br>The choice of the magnitude to be presented must be in accordance with the message 	|
| *literary styles* 	| And in all of the above there is a lot of room for personal taste                                                                                                                                                                                                 	|

The ultimate roots of the study of graphic information or visual information are found in psychology, since the elementary processes that participate in it are those related to perception (the initial capture of the visual message) and cognition (the generation of an image operational mental from the perceived). 

  
Following Yuri Engelhardt, we can consider a particular visual language as a "notation scheme", a more technical name that will allow us to specify details. Humans use different types of mindsets to cognitively structure our experiences, and "notation patterns" are mindsets that deal with the use of representations.   
  
The notation scheme of a graphic representation is made up of two parts: a “component scheme” and a “composition scheme.” The component scheme encompasses the information about the visual components that appear in the graphic representation (it is the “vocabulary visual ”of representation), and on the meaning of those visual components. The composition scheme, on the other hand, includes information on the principles of visual composition according to which the visual components must be combined (it would be the "visual grammar" of the representation), and on the meaning of those principles of composition.  
  
These basic or pure schemes are combined in turn through a series of mechanisms (simultaneous combination, nesting, etc.) that are also limited and known. In this way all the relationships between the isolated icons (components) that appear on a graph are described by a small set of basic processes.  
  
Each of the seven composition schemes described is related to
a simple geometric perceptual characteristic:

- Linear sequencing.
- Link (by lines or arrows) 13.
- Separation.
- Grouping by proximity.
- Containment (enclosure in boxes).
- Overlap.
- Metric shaft.
