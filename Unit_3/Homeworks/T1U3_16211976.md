# MACHINE LEARNING
**Answer the following questions**

1. What is machine learning?
    
    Autonomous learning is the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that isfocuses on developing systems that learn, or improve performance, based onof the data they consume. Artificial intelligence is a broad term that refers toto systems or machines that mimic human intelligence. It is often mentioned autonomous learning and AI in the same conversations, and the terms toThey are sometimes used interchangeably, but they don't mean the same thing. An important aspect toIt should be noted that although all autonomous learning is AI, not all AI is learning autonomous


2. Where is Machine Learning used?

    Depending on the focus of these may be some of the objectives
    - Customer life time value
    - Anomaly detection
    - Dynamic pricing
    - Predictive maintenance
    - Image classification
    - Recommendation engines

    speaking of specific points:
    - cost detection
    - Gmail
    - Antivirus
    - Autonomous vehicles
    



3. What is linear regression for?

    Simple linear regression consists of generating a regression model a line that allows to explain the linear relationship that exists between two variables. To dependent variable or response is identified as Y and the predictor variable or independent as X.


4. Explain your observations of the linear regression plot generated in R

The first thing we can see in the graphs is that the first 5 years in the training set around 70% of the people have a lower income salary with respect to the prediction where we can see that you have an income constant to his years of experience. After 5 years we can observe that in the training graph it is quite constant with respect to the ages even more constant than the prediction chart, in which we can see that there are income peaks that say they can earn more than planned. As a conclusion we can say that in the initial 5 years within the labor area it is still very low, that is why we always see applications looking for 7-10 years of experience because companies see it as a better investment someone with an experience of more than 5 years
